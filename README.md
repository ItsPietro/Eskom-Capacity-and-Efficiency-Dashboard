# Eskom-Capacity-and-Efficiency-Dashboard

We used the Eskom data to build an informative dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. 

The dashboard, with its underlying reports, was used to derive insight into the South African energy crisis.

### Data Source
The `Eskom Electric Stations Capacities.xlsx` dataset and the `Eskom power stations efficiencies.xlsx` dataset used for building the informative dashboard. 

- Both datasets were loaded into Power BI and relationships between the datasets created.

- With the Eskom Efficiencies and Capacities datasets now sourced and the relationships created, the data was cleaned to get it in a workable format by replacing the empty or null value columns with the column average.
  
Three dashboards were created from the datasets, namely; 
1) infrastructure dashboard.
2) Eskom capacity and efficiency dashboard.
3) the twitter dashboard.

### Insights
The infrastructure dashboard gives us insight into attributes of each station. Using Power BI slicers and filters we can draw correlations between station attributes, and explore and analyse this dataset in-depth. The Eskom capacity and efficiency dashboard provides information on individual station performance. The twitter dashboard summarises Eskom mentions (@) and tags (#) over a defined period.
